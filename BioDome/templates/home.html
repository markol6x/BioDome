    <p>Further evidence in favor of Mcm10 altering CMG conformation stems from our observation that Mcm10 stabilizes and activates the CMG complex (Fig. 3 and 6). Consistent with the Mcm10-dependent CMG stabilization being due to a conformational change, we find that stabilization does not require the continued presence of Mcm10 (Fig. 3B). It is unclear what molecular event causes CMG stabilization and when it occurs relative to helicase activation. Mcm10-dependent movement of the Mcm2 A-subdomain could reveal additional interaction regions on Mcm2-7 for Cdc45 and GINS, resulting in enhanced stability and helicase activation. Alternatively, Mcm10-dependent stabilization of the CMG complex could occur as a consequence of helicase activation or extrusion of ssDNA from the Mcm2-7 central channel <span id="__Fieldmark__671_3205866301" class="anchor"></span>(<span id="__Fieldmark__578_3683559902" class="anchor"></span>F<span id="__Fieldmark__1968_3694128450" class="anchor"></span>u et al. 2011). For example, the ssDNA generated by one or both of these events could interact with Cdc45 or GINS <span id="__Fieldmark__682_3205866301" class="anchor"></span>(<span id="__Fieldmark__585_3683559902" class="anchor"></span>C<span id="__Fieldmark__1973_3694128450" class="anchor"></span>osta et al. 2014) resulting in stabilized CMG complexes. Supporting this possibility, Cdc45 is related to the bacterial RecJ ssDNA nuclease and has been shown to bind ssDNA <span id="__Fieldmark__693_3205866301" class="anchor"></span>(<span id="__Fieldmark__592_3683559902" class="anchor"></span>B<span id="__Fieldmark__1978_3694128450" class="anchor"></span>ruck and Kaplan 2013; Petojevic et al. 2015). Finally, given the potential role of OB-fold domains in ssDNA interactions <span id="__Fieldmark__705_3205866301" class="anchor"></span>(<span id="__Fieldmark__600_3683559902" class="anchor"></span>F<span id="__Fieldmark__1984_3694128450" class="anchor"></span>roelich et al. 2014; Ashton et al. 2013) it is also possible that release from the A-subdomain allows the Mcm2 OB-fold domain to form more productive interactions with translocating ssDNA. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.</p>
    <p>Our studies combined with previous data suggest that the Mcm2 A-domain/OB-fold interface is a nexus for interactions that regulate Mcm2-7 activity. In addition to inhibiting Mcm10 binding, mutations at this interface also lead to reduced Cdc45 and GINS recruitment (Fig. 3D). These defects are consistent with interactions between Cdc45 and Mcm2 A-subdomain observed in the CMG structure (Yuan et al., 2015, Fig. 2A). Interestingly, of the three OB-fold/A-subdomain interface mutants we tested <em>in vitro</em>, the stronger Mcm10 bypass allele (<em>mcm2-bom1</em>) has only minor CMG formation defects (Fig. 3D). Thus, bypassing Mcm10 function may involve a balance between opening the OB-fold/A-subdomain interface while not disrupting interactions necessary for Cdc45 and GINS binding.</p>
    <p>Several explanations are possible for <em>mcm2-bom1</em> and <em>mcm2-bom1</em> not being able to bypass a complete <em>MCM10</em> deletion (Fig. S1C). It is possible that a small amount of residual Mcm10 function is required to allow cells to grow in the presence of the bypass alleles. Futhermore, the inability to bypass <em>Δmcm10</em> could be due to incomplete disruption of the A-subdomain/OB-fold interaction in <em>mcm2-bom1</em> or <em>mcm2-bom2</em>. Given that Mcm10 catalyzes the committed step of replication initiation, another possibility is that Mcm10 bypass may lead to a deleterious loss of coordination between replication initiation events. Alternatively, Mcm10 could have an additional essential function beyond helicase activation.</p>
    <p><strong>Mcm10 stimulates replication elongation</strong></p>
    <p>We provide both <em>in vivo</em> (Fig. 6) and <em>in vitro</em> (Fig. 4) evidence that Mcm10 stimulates replication elongation. Consistent with a role for Mcm10 in elongation, previous studies have found that Mcm10 travels with the replisome <span id="__Fieldmark__745_3205866301" class="anchor"></span>(<span id="__Fieldmark__636_3683559902" class="anchor"></span>G<span id="__Fieldmark__2051_3694128450" class="anchor"></span>ambus et al. 2006; Pacek et al. 2006; Ricke and Bielinsky 2004). <span id="__Fieldmark__756_3205866301" class="anchor"></span>(<span id="__Fieldmark__643_3683559902" class="anchor"></span>G<span id="__Fieldmark__2056_3694128450" class="anchor"></span>ambus et al., 2006; Pacek et al., 2006). Furthermore, a temperature-sensitive allele of <em>MCM10</em> (<em>mcm10-1</em>) causes replication fork pausing at the restricted temperature <span id="__Fieldmark__773_3205866301" class="anchor"></span>(<span id="__Fieldmark__656_3683559902" class="anchor"></span>H<span id="__Fieldmark__2070_3694128450" class="anchor"></span>omesley et al. 2000; Merchant et al. 1997). Supporting the importance of this function, we note that the elongation-defective <em>mcm10-A3</em> allele is unable to complement the lethal depletion of Mcm10-FRB (Fig. 6B).</p>
    <p>Although a precise mechanism for Mcm10 stimulation of elongation remains to be determined, our studies provide insights into this control. The finding that Mcm10 stabilizes the CMG complex (Fig. 3B) raises the possibility that Mcm10 binding stimulates elongation by enhancing the processivity of the CMG complex. In addition, Mcm2-7<sup>2-bom1</sup> and Mcm2-7<sup>2-bom2</sup> both lead to longer replication products suggesting that conformational changes in the OB-fold/A-subdomain interface contribute to elongation. It is possible that Mcm10 binding drives changes in the OB-fold/A-subdomain interface and that this has a direct impact on the stability or speed of the CMG. Alternatively, changes induced by Mcm10 binding could alter interactions of Cdc45 and GINS with Mcm2-7. Further detailed biochemical studies will be required to test these possibilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Does Mcm10 activate initiation and elongation by the same mechanism?</strong></p>
    <p>Whether Mcm10 functions during replication initiation and elongation by the same or different mechanisms remains to be determined. The simplest model is that Mcm10 stimulates both events by the same mechanism. Consistent with this idea, our <em>in vitro</em> analyses of the Mcm10-bypass mutants suggest that both the initiation and elongation functions of Mcm10 are impacted by these mutants. The ability to detect replication products in these assays indicates that these mutants facilitate initiation in the absence of Mcm10 (Fig. 3F). Two observations suggest that the elongation function of Mcm10 is also altered by these mutations. First, in the absence of Mcm10, the length of <em>in vitro</em> replication products correlates with the strength of the Mcm10 bypass allele (Fig. 3F). Second, when WT Mcm10 is present, Mcm2-7<sup>2-bom1</sup> and Mcm2-7<sup>2-bom2</sup> produce longer replication products (Fig. 3F).</p>
    <p>On the other hand, we identified an <em>MCM10</em> allele (<em>mcm10-A3</em>) that shows differential effects on replication initiation and elongation. This protein is defective for stimulation of replication elongation (Fig. 6Aiii) and binding to the CMG (Fig. 6Ai), but exhibits similar capabilities as WT Mcm10 to form salt-stable CMG complexes and stimulate initial DNA unwinding (Figs. 6Ai, 6Aii and S5C). These findings suggest that stable binding to the CMG correlates with the ability to stimulate replication elongation and suggests that a different interaction is involved in stabilizing the CMG and stimulating initial DNA unwinding. Further experiments will be necessary to determine if and how the Mcm10 mechanism of function differs between initiation and elongation.</p>
